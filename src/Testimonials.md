## "Super quick, unflappable, and solution-focused"

I worked with Amy on 2 healthcare-focused projects at Mace & Menter.

Aside from being really very good at content design, Amy's super quick, unflappable, and solution-focused. The project would have been so much poorer without her - she joined an in-flight team, picked everything up within a matter of hours, and from then on took full responsibility for making sure that everything got done that needed to be done. I wouldn't hesitate to work with her again.

## "The most talented content person I know"

Amy is the most talented content person I know. I hired her to edit my Learn Eleventy from Scratch course and she completely transformed it into a supremely solid content system. I’ve now got a style guide not just for design system elements, but also for language and tone, which will have a huge, long term positive impact on my business.

Her work has not only had a huge impact on the project I hired her for—but on me in general. I feel like I have learned more about writing during this project with Amy than I have in all my years of writing. I couldn’t recommend that your hire her more if I tried.

## "A programatic and inclusive leader"

Amy joined our design system team at Babylon Health as product manager, instantly demonstrating programatic leadership, balancing getting stuff done with getting stuff done well.

Amy’s experience working on award-winning design systems coupled with an extensive content design background was evident through her ability to see through the distracting muse of perfectionism, and provide clear direction on what good looks like and needs to be.

In a short space of time, Amy has lead the transformation of a fairly siloed team, into a candid collaborative team environment that fosters inclusivity, ensuring every team member is able to contribute ideas, be heard, and be valued.

## "Clarity is her superpower"

Amy is one of the most talented content designers I’ve ever worked with. Clarity is her superpower, and she makes everything structured and straightforward with words. Her success as a Product Manager at Babylon Health was in no small part linked to her ability to write clearly and concisely.  

She possesses a rare, sharp focus on bringing clarity to products, content and team structures—her fantastic communication skills help teams to thrive.

She’s also a funny, down to earth person and a joy to work with. It's refreshing to have intense, engaging conversations with her.

## "Hard working and relentlessly user-focussed"

I worked with Amy for 3 years on the GOV.UK Design System, where she led the development of guidance and documentation for our 3 products.

She did so much more than that though - improving our information architecture, service delivery and internal processes, supporting users and contributors and promoting the work of the team via blogging and conference talks.

She's smart, incredibly hard working and relentlessly user-focussed. She's fun to work with and brings huge energy to any team she's on.

I'd work with her again like THAT.

## "Helps others do their <br>best work"

Having worked closely with Amy on the GOV.UK Design System, I can say she’s been key in the impact it has had today in the wider community in government (and private sector!).

Amy has always kept an eye on the wider picture, focused on user needs, asking the hard questions when needed, and building good relationships with stakeholders and users. As a content design lead, she is service-orientated and thinks strategically about all the aspects of the service and its products (onboarding, support, contribution, maintenance).

Her work has helped make the design system become more representative and increase its adoption by enabling advocators to help us build a community for the GOV.UK Design System.

From inclusive documentation, to safe and fair community spaces, to supporting contributors in contributing to the system, to running cross government workshops. Amy is as strategic as she is hands-on, and knows when to put the right hat on. She’s practical, friendly and helps others do their best work.

## "The ability to make sense of any mess"

I worked closely with Amy on the GOV.UK Design System for 3 years. Amy has the ability to make sense of any mess. Whether it’s regarding technology or more philosophical topics she is able to quickly get to the core of any problem, express it in a way that everyone understands and find solutions that work for both users and the organisation.

Amy works amazingly well in isolation but her knack of getting everyone involved through running workshops, show and tells, writing blog posts and speaking publicly created an open, inclusive culture and way of working within the team that influenced the organisation as a whole.

Amy is a delight to work with and would be a major asset to any team

## "A brilliant content designer"

I absolutely love working with Amy because while she’s a brilliant content designer, her skill extends far beyond that. She’s an excellent service designer, communicator and facilitator too. 

She has been the face of the GOV.UK Design System and played a major role in fostering a wonderful design community around it. I simply can’t recommend Amy highly enough and will make efforts to work with her again.

## "Very driven"

I had the pleasure of seeing Amy work with the GOV.UK Design System team for more than a year. Amy is an incredibly talented Content Designer, and she really pushed the whole Design System content forward in the time she was on the team. Being the sole content person for much of this time, she was the go to expert for all things content (and many other areas too!)

She's very driven, and doesn't shy away from difficult problems. Always asking questions that others may not have considered, and is willing to act on the responses even when outside her area of expertise. Amy will quickly become a valuable asset to any team she works on.
