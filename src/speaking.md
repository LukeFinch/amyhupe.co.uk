sub: Alongside working with clients, I regularly speak about my work at conferences and meetups, and on panels.

Most of my talks are on the subject of content design, design systems, or a combination of the two.

I'm currently taking bookings for events in 2023.

## Events I speak at

As with my work, a strong theme of the talks I give is inclusivity and human-centeredness. 

With that in mind, I prioritise speaking at events where the origanisers have made a clear effort to recruit a diverse lineup of speakers and to support people from all backgrounds to attend.

I will not participate in any panels or speak at any events with all-white lineups.

If you think I'd be a good fit for your event, [get in touch](/contact).
