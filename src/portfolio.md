## Content strategy and contribution for the GOV.UK Design System

January 2017 - January 2020

For 3 years I worked at the UK Government Digital Service (GDS) as content lead for the GOV.UK Design System and GOV.UK Frontend.

I joined the project in its alpha phase, and remained on the team as it moved through private beta and for 18 months after its launch. 

I lead on developing the team’s documentation strategy with a focus on simplicity and inclusion. I worked to design guidance and documentation that was findable, accessible and comprehensive for around 700 teams who'd be using it. Those teams included a mix of people—from those new to government to seasoned civil servants; designers, content designers, developers, product managers and user researchers; and junior practitioners to experienced experts. 

In addition, I worked closely with our service designer and then independently to develop a cross-government contribution model.

## Product managing the Babylon Health design system

January - May 2020

In January 2020, I embarked on a 3 month contract to product manage Babylon Health’s design system—[Babylon DNA](https://dna.babylonhealth.com/ )—with the objective of launching it to the organisation. Unlike the GOV.UK Design System, Babylon DNA had 3 platforms to support: web, iOS and Android, which presented additional challenges. 

After successfully supporting the team to launch DNA, my contract was extended for a further 6 months and my focus shifted to driving adoption and developing a contribution model that the team could maintain whilst continuing to build the system.

Unfortunately, just a few weeks into my extension, I suffered a rare illness called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome which meant I had to terminate my contract prematurely and take 2 months off to recover.

## Leading a team to develop a multi-brand design system for BT, EE & Plusnet

July 2020 - March 2021

I spent 9 months as product owner for the design system at BT. Working with a newly-formed team, I lead a discovery into BT’s requirements for a design system.

As well as supporting multiple platforms, BT’s design system needed to support the 3 distinct and well-established telecoms brands within the BT Group umbrella: BT, EE and Plusnet. 

I guided the team and worked with stakeholders to create a research-led roadmap which set out plans for a staggered rollout to the business, which was undertaking a large-scale digital transformation programme and replatforming its products to a new React-based frontend framework.

By the time I left BT, we had launched a private beta of the design system, including design tokens, a component library, a corresponding Figma library, design and technical documentation and a support process to 3 high-priority product teams within the organisation.
