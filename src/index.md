heading: Hello.
sub: I'm Amy. I'm a content designer and design systems expert, making the case for simplicity and inclusion in the face of complexity.
---

Right now, I'm product managing the design system at [Babylon Health](babylonhealth.com).

Before that, I spent 3 years working at the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) on the [GOV.‌UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

And prior to GDS, I worked at [Which?](https://www.which.co.uk/) writing about everything from compost to conveyancing. 

I care about making services accessible and inclusive, starting with the basics – the words we use to talk about them.

I also make food and take [photographs](https://www.instagram.com/saltsweetsourspice/) of it.
