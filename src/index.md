Right now, I'm working on design systems at [Springer Nature](https://www.springernature.com/gp).

I've worked as product owner for design systems at [BT](https://www.bt.com/broadband/deals?s_cid=con_ppc_maxus_vidZ60_T1&vendorid=Z60&ds_rl=1000720&ds_rl=1276299&ds_rl=1276299&gclid=CjwKCAjwjLD4BRAiEiwAg5NBFrjq0XCXNtJ3XyMsXWY4SKSQhRhBAIKRbfG1_ZsBxhGvWYcSOG78ehoC_q4QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) and [Babylon Health](https://www.babylonhealth.com/) and I spent 3 years at the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service) as content lead for the [GOV.‌UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

Prior to GDS, I worked at [Which?](https://www.which.co.uk/) writing about everything from compost to conveyancing. 

I care about making services accessible and inclusive, starting with the basics – the words we use to talk about them.
