description: Why we should stop saying design systems solve the easy problems, so you can focus on the hard ones

On Thursday, I read a [brilliant blog post about Barnardo’s design system](https://blog.barnar.do/introducing-the-barnardos-design-system-456769277f79). 

There’s lots to say about this work, but for now I want to talk about this paragraph:

_“Designers and developers want to focus their time on solving the problems unique to their product, instead of spending time reinventing the wheel on things like how navigation should work or what a button should look like.”_

I was surprised but happy to see this explanation instead of the common alternative, which says that “Design systems solve the easy problems, so teams can focus on fixing the hard ones”.

Let me explain.

## Design systems fix the common problems, not the easy ones

Design systems exist to stop teams doubling up their efforts fixing the same problems, like how to write an error message, or create a call to action on a page, over and over again.

By providing tried and tested solutions to these problems, supported with usage guidelines and code, they can reduce duplication of effort and create consistency across one or more products. 

But ask almost anyone who has worked on or contributed to a design system and they’ll tell you there’s nothing easy about it.

Making something that meets the needs of thousands of different users, accommodates organisational requirements and limitations, and is versatile enough to be reused, is really very hard indeed. 

It’s far fairer and more accurate to say that design systems solve common problems, not necessarily easy ones. 

## Design systems come with a lot of hard problems

Providing common design solutions is just one of the hard problems that design systems have to address.

For starters, you need to support the teams who use the system. Unless your design system was built on day one of your organisation, you’ll likely need to help teams embed it into existing products and services. Not just once but continuously.

It’s not enough to just publish a component or a pattern and leave it there to rot. You have to provide a framework for people to feedback on its performance, and use that feedback to evolve it iteratively over time. 

The system needs to provide reliable, durable and accessible solutions that fairly represent the teams, services and users it serves. You need to enable people to contribute their own work and research. Again, not just once but constantly, continuously. 

Our service designer [Ignacia Orellana](https://twitter.com/ignaciaorellana) and I have written before about [how we opened up the GOV.UK Design System for contribution](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2018/09/26/opening-up-the-gov-uk-design-system-for-contributions/). 

To say it was challenging would be an understatement, and we’re not done yet. Not even close. 

As my colleague [Nick Colley put it](https://twitter.com/NickColley/status/1101401221078966272):

_“It's easy to build something that no one can use or input into. It's hard to build something that's useful for many teams and can be contributed to.”_

## Hard work is a selling point

I don’t have evidence for this, but I strongly suspect that one reason we describe design system problems as “easy” is because we think it’ll help drive adoption.

By reducing the development of simple user interface elements to an “easy problem”, we think we’ll somehow put people off doing it. 

After all, who on earth would want to waste their time doing something as menial as designing a button when they could be focusing on so many more worthy, interesting, _difficult_ problems? 

It’s a nice narrative, but it doesn’t hold up. It’s too reductive and it undermines the hard work of design system teams and contributors. 

It’s far better to sell a system on the basis of its strengths, reliability and with an honest portrayal of all the hard work that’s gone into it. 

## We are not competing for hard problems

Working on a design system is hard. Working on a product or service team is hard, too.
There are more than enough hard problems to go around and the difficulty of one doesn’t diminish the difficulty of another.

The job of a product or service team is to deliver helpful, considerate and positive solutions to help meet its particular set of users' needs.
 
The job of a design system is to provide a start point for the _common problems_—a set of reusable solutions validated through robust research, and continually iterated upon.

It's only by sharing the load of our problems, both the easy and the hard ones, that we'll have a chance of solving them.
