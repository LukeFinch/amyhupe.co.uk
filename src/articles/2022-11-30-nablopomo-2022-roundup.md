description: Here's what I learned from another year of NaBloPoMo

---

National Blog Posting Month - affectionately known as NaBloPoMo - is a challenge in which participants write a blog post every day throughout November. 

The idea is to help bloggers develop a consistent writing habit, and break away from perfectionist ideals that might otherwise prevent them from sharing their work.

I've just taken part for the second year running - here's a quick summary of what I wrote, and some reflections.

## The blog posts

Like last year, I gave myself weekends off writing, and set myself a goal of writing every weekday.

I'm pleased to say that I hit my target, and am rounding off the month having written and published 22 new blog posts, including this one.

1. [National Blog Posting Month: day 1](/articles/national-blog-posting-month-2022/)
2. [Should consistency be a goal of design systems?](/articles/should-consistency-be-a-goal-for-design-systems/)
3. [Why we need to test our content with marginalised users](/articles/why-to-test-content-with-marginalised-users/)
4. [Tension: Relfections from leading Design Conference 2022](https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/tension-leading-design/)
5. [It's OK](/articles/its-ok/)
6. [Your Figma library is not a design system. So what?](/articles/figma-is-not-a-design-system/)
7. [Cultivating design systems by bringing intention](/articles/bringing-intention-to-design-systems/)
8. [The case for jargon](/articles/the-case-for-jargon/)
9. [A complete list of the times when it's OK to use lorem ipsum instead of real content in your design work](/articles/lorem-ipsum/)
10. [Inclusion doesn't come for free with open source software](/articles/open-source-does-not-mean-inclusive/)
11. [Building conscious design systems](/articles/building-conscious-design-systems/)
12. [Making space for multiple truths: Reflections from FF Conf 2022](/articles/making-space-for-multiple-truths/) 
13. [I'm a design systems consultant and I'm fine with duplication of effort](/articles/why-i-support-duplicated-effort/)
14. [Dear male ego](/articles/dear-male-ego/)
15. [Notes on coffee](articles/notes-on-coffee/)
16. [Single source of whatever: reflections from this month's design systems open space](/articles/single-source-whatever/)
17. [Down with dogma](/articles/down-with-dogma/)
18. [Should design systems include problematic components and patterns?](/should-design-sytsmes-include-anti-patterns/)
19. [So, are you thinking of having kids?](/articles/do-you-want-kids/)
20. [We document our design systems - why don't we systematise our documentation?](articles/modular-design-system-documentation/)
21. [A new barrier to communicating about design systems](/articles/explaining-design-systems/)
22. The one you're reading :) 

## The winners

Based on the amount of feedback, likes, shares and (whispers) clicks each post got, the one that people liked best by some margin was [So, are you thinking of having kids?](/articles/do-you-want-kids/). I'm happy about this, since it was probably the scariest and most vulnerable piece of writing I've ever shared.

People also seemed to especially like [Dear male ego](/articles/dear-male-ego/), [A complete list of the times when it's OK to use lorem ipsum instead of real content in your design work](/articles/lorem-ipsum/) and [We document our design systems - why don't we systematise our documentation?](articles/modular-design-system-documentation/).

## Lessons learned

- **Preparation is key.** I did some work to get ahead last year with a list of topic ideas and drafts, and boy oh boy does it make a difference. Coming up with a new idea and starting from scratch every day is not for the faint-hearted.
- **I'm still a raging perfectionist.** My perfectionist brain is very all or nothing, so I knew if I missed a day I would just give up altogether. I also didn't cut myself much slack in terms of quality. I put a lot of effort into most of the posts I wrote which leaves me happy with my output, but very, very tired.
- **It's been good to reboot my writing practice.** Once again, I really enjoyed NaBloPoMo and I’ll do it again next year. (I’m also really glad it’s over for this year!) Doing the challenge has reaffirmed for me that I can and should write more in general. I often wait until I’ve got a really solid idea, and spend ages on it, and there’s something nice about just saying “I’m going to publish something today” and going for it.
- **No writer is an island.** Writing (nearly) every day for a whole month is quite an undertaking, and I'm not sure I could do it without the support and encouragement of others. So a huge thank you to everyone who's taken the time to feedback on and share my posts - it really has made all the difference. Also a big thank you to [Steve Messer](https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser) for setting up a Slack support group for some of us taking part. Having a little accountability / cheerleading group really helped.

## That's a wrap

I've loved writing every day, and I'm ready for a little pause now to let some new ideas bubble up and marinate.

This challenge is, for me, a brilliant reminder of the importance of balance.

It's wonderful to prove to myself that I can write consistently, when I put my mind to it. And I'm just as grateful for the opportunity now to slow down and invest time in some posts that need a bit more consideration.

Until next year, I bid my daily writing practice adieu.

I hope you've enjoyed reading along.
