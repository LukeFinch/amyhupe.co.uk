description: How I've used my core perspective to create meaning and order in my chaotic career.
---

My background is in content design, and most of my career has been focused on that.

Over the past 11 years I’ve spent:

- 6 years at Which?, working in publishing, moving through the roles of researcher, writer, editor and digital content creator
- 3 years at the Government Digital Service, working as content lead for the GOV.UK Design System
- 4 months contracting at Babylon Health as a product manager for their design system, before leaving abruptly due to illness
- 2 months doing sporadic freelance editing and copywriting while I recovered
- 9 months contracting at BT as product owner for their design systems
- 6 months contracting with Mace and Menter on 2 local NHS services

Now I’m working on design systems at Springer Nature. I joined as a content designer, but after discussions with my client about what they most needed, I’ve ended up doing more of the strategic planning I might have done as a product manager.

## I’m so random - wanna hire me?

On the one hand, broadening my skills and experience is no bad thing. As a contractor, it means I can offer more services and consider a wider range of opportunities, which so far has meant a steady stream of work.

On the other hand, I started to worry that I was building a meaningless mish-mash of a portfolio. I feared that would put clients off, and I wondered how I would create a sense of purpose and cohesiveness for myself within this ostensibly random collection of projects.

So the big question I had was: can I find a common thread that allows me to explain to myself and others exactly what it is that I do?

## Bringing order to chaos with a core perspective

Inspiration struck last year when I sent myself on a brilliant 6 week coaching course: [Sara Wachter-Boettcher’s Courageous Leadership programme](https://www.activevoicehq.com/group-coaching).

Sara encouraged us to think about our own triad of values, skills, and experiences, which we then used to come up with a short statement, which she calls a “core perspective”.

This was mine:

_”I want to share the importance of open, inclusive communication and practices when building systems. I approach this work from my unique viewpoint as someone with relative power and privilege, who has experienced exclusion. I do this because I believe people can bring value and make positive change when they’re empowered to participate.”_

Writing this core perspective helped me to see the common narrative in my career. It continues to help me to assess new opportunities by asking:
- is this in line with my values?
- will I find it meaningful?
- will I be able to apply my skills and experience?

It’s helped me to avoid the temptation of roles that offer a good day rate but nothing else, or high-profile roles that I know would look good on my CV, but aren’t quite right for me.

I know it’s an incredible privilege to be able to make these choices. It’s one I know I might not always have, and that I’m extremely thankful for while I do.

## Evolving my perspective over time

I expect and plan to revisit and update my core perspective statement over the next few years, as my values evolve, and my experiences (and hopefully skills) grow.

I actually made a tweak to my statement when I wrote this blog post. I changed “design systems” to “systems”, to make space for the work I did with Mace and Menter which I gained a lot from, and would like to do more of in future.

However, having a more stable concept of “what it is I do” helps me understand my purpose and values, and create meaning in my career.
