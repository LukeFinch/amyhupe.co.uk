In January last year, I took part in [Veganuary](https://veganuary.com/)—a campaign which encourages people to eat vegan for a whole month.

Like a lot of people, I want to reduce my meat and dairy intake and eat more sustainably-sourced plant-based foods.

I also felt stuck in a bit of a food rut, and as someone who usually enjoys cooking (and, of course, eating), I wanted to see if introducing a constraint to my diet would help me find new meals and rediscover my culinary creativity.

It did.

Here’s a round up of my favourite recipes and discoveries from that experiment.

## Vegan recipes round-up

- Planet friendly bolognese from [Gizzi Erskine’s Slow](https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9780008291945?gC=5a105e8b&gclid=CjwKCAiA1aiMBhAUEiwACw25MVVMEsu4dG83KxXNq7W5sStMsQDS3VevOnePldSiOsvuJfgnTx1uNBoCergQAvD_BwE) - as the book title suggests, this takes a while to make. On the plus side, the recipe makes a large amount and it’s great for freezing and using in pasta dishes, cottage pie, and other mince-based dishes
- [Jamie Oliver’s vegan shepherd’s pie](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/vegetables-recipes/vegan-shepherd-s-pie/) - I like this because it’s not trying to taste like meat. It’s just a delicious, flavoursome and comforting vegan pie
- [Madhur Jaffrey’s mushrooms with chickpeas](https://www.foodandspice.com/2010/12/chickpeas-with-mushrooms.html) - serve with rice, naan, or in wraps with a dollop of coconut yoghurt. I like to add spinach
- [Meera Sodha’s scrambled tofu akuri](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/19/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-scrambled-tofu-akuri-ginger-garlic-chilli) - if you’re not sold on the idea of scrambled tofu (I certainly was not), this might just convert you
- [Burnt aubergine chilli](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/burnt-aubergine-veggie-chilli)  hands down the best vegetarian chilli I’ve ever had (and I’ve had many) - we’ve made this over and over. Don’t worry if you’re not into aubergines - they melt away and you don’t really know they’re there
- [Buffalo cauliflower tacos](https://pinchofyum.com/buffalo-cauliflower-tacos-avocado-crema) - who doesn’t love tacos?
- [Yotam Ottolenghi’s french beans and tofu with chraimeh sauce](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/02/hot-sauce-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-chicken-wings-prawn-pasties-green-beans) - it’s all in the sauce which I immediately wanted to eat on absolutely everything
- [Dishoom’s jackfruit biryani](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/07/four-classic-indian-recipes-dishoom-chaat-dal-salad-jackfruit-biyani-chicken-makhani-curry) - this is one of my favourite things to order in a Dishoom restaurant and I’m pleased to say the make-at-home version is just as good. You’ll need to swap the yoghurt, butter and cream for plant-based alternatives. The Dishoom cookbook gives suggestions
- [Rukmini Iyer’s lime and coconut dal](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jan/25/20-best-curry-recipes-rukmini-iyer-lime-and-coconut-dal) - comforting with a kick, and very delicious

## Other vegan cooking ideas

As well as specific recipes, I also found a number of tricks that helped us keep going.

- Make a batch of [salsa macha](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/salsa-macha) (a dark, sticky Mexican peanut and chilli dressing) and have it on everything
- Pickles make everything more interesting
- Nuts make most things more interesting
- A couple of squares of dark chocolate in your (plant-based milk) porridge will change your life. Salted almonds on top will change it even more
- After extensive research I can confirm that the [H!p](https://hipchocolate.com/) salted caramel chocolate is the best vegan chocolate around (not a spon)
- I strongly advise you not to bother even trying with vegan versions of cheese*, yorkshire puddings, cream, eggs
- *The exception to the cheese rule is smoked gouda but **only** when used in cooking, not eaten “straight”
- [Ben and Jerry’s Non-Dairy Phish Food ice cream](https://www.benjerry.com/flavors/phish-food-non-dairy/pint) tastes as good as the dairy version
