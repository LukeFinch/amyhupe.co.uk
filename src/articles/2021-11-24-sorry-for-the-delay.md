It’s just that:

- I’ve been totally swamped at work
- I’ve not been feeling well this week
- I was having a panic attack
- I’ve been thinking about how our society prioritises instant gratification too much and I’m busy writing you a letter
- My cat required my attention
- I like you an awful lot and I want to give your response the attention it deserves
- It takes more energy to respond to your email about my subject of professional expertise than it does to subtweet Boris Johnson. This isn’t a reflection of my respect for you. Please don’t DM me to highlight this perceived inconsistency
- I had something typed to you but I’ve just found it sitting in my drafts! Don’t know what happened there.... 
- Someone needs me more than you right now
- You sent me a detailed message and I need time to process it before I reply otherwise it’ll seem like I didn’t pay attention and I don’t care
- I can’t quite get my head around the fact we’re still sending emails in the apocalypse
- I really care about this response and I don’t have the bandwidth to write something that reflects that right now
- My broadband went down
- I needed to scroll through every eBay listing for a Shrimps coat
- I was taking a lateral flow test for the 5th time today
- ~~I was talked into another wine~~ actually no, that’s a bit Live, Laugh, Love
- Everything seems futile
- I feel happy for the first time in a while and I wanted to spend those precious moments somewhere else
- I was paralysed into action by the guilt of all the messages I haven’t responded to
- I’m ~~a poor excuse for~~ a human
